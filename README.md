# A beginner's guide to machine learning

The Internet is full of great open-source materials, books, blogs and articles in this topic, and it is not easy to decide what to read first if you are a beginner. I have decided to learn about AI and ML a month ago, now my aim is to help people who are also novices but interested in these topics. I will collect here everything I read with links and short desciptions. I intend to structure the content in a step-by-step guide that would make it easier to comprehend.

## The background
- Probability theory
- Linear algebra
- Programing languages, frameworks, libraries

## Optimization
- Linear regression
- Least squares
- Polynomial fitting
- Multivariate polynomial fitting

## Neural network basics
- Gradient descent
- Stochastic gradient descent
- Back propagation

## ???

## Common abbreviations
- AI - Artifical Inteligence
- ML - Machine Learning
- ANN - Artificial Neural Network
- DNN - Deep Neural Network: NN with many hidden layers)
- CNN - Convolutional Neural Network
- RNN - Recurrent Neural Network
- MLP - Multi Layer Perceptron
- ReLU - Rectified Linear Unit
